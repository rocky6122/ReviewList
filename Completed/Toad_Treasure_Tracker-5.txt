Thoughts:
Toad Treasure Tracker is a very peculiar game. Based off a series of mini-levels in Mario Galaxy 2,
it follows Captain Toad; who without jumping traverses small puzzle box like worlds to collect 
gems and complete puzzles. The idea is quite genius, a great feature in Mario Galaxy 2. The way they
fleshed this game out with more puzzles is astonishing. Toads Treasure Tracker boasts around 80 levels,
of which I have fuilly completed 75. I also found all of the gems, completed every bonus mission, and found every
pixel toad. Some puzzles are much better than others, but there are only a handful that I found to be 
frustrating or bad. My only main problem with this game is that perhaps it overstayed its welcome. Now this
could be due to me trying to 100% every puzzle, but after level 50 or so I began wishing for the end.
While the games puzzles are different and unique, the game does little to add to its mechanical aspect,
with no new abilities ever being added or built upon; its simply just one level after another. Ultimately, I'm glad
this game exists and expands the level selection of its original mingame status, but without adding new mechanics,
it can only go so far in holding my positive attention.
