Thoughts:
Taking the original game and enhancing upon its core, The Room Three is the best game in the series. While the puzzles remain
the same level of difficulty, the showmanship of the animations and puzzle boxes is stunning. The jaw dropping animations
as puzzle boxes morph into castles and planets spin in orreries is really quite the spectacle, which made streaming the game 
for friends a fun experience. If you can, I recommend playing with a friend so you can enjoy the puzzle solving together.
