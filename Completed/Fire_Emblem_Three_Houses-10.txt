Thoughts:
Everytime I play a new Fire Emblem I feel like they just keep out doing themselves. Not only 
is the combat more streamlined than ever, but the social aspects of the game have been expanded
into a full on relationship sim. The game has 34 (fully voice acted) playable characters to recruit and interact with
and each one manages to full unique and fully fleshed out as individuals. The central plot is also
engaging, dealing mainly in the political intrigue of a Continent with 3 major powers poised for war.
Allowing the player to choose which House to side with in the game was a fun way to create branching narratives,
and I am quite frankly blown away at how good my story was for being just one of several branches. It was so good
that I genuinely cannot imagine the narrative having unfolded any other way, which I think says something
to the quality of the writing.
When a game series comes to Switch it seems to always up the ante as to what a game in the franchise can be,
and Fire Emblem: Three Houses is no different. The game is fresh, thoughtful, and the raw amount of detail put 
into each moment of the game feels like something worthy of a top Switch game contender. I wouldn't be suprised
if this game ended up on my "Top 10 Switch games" list once the console reached the end of its life cycle.
Brilliant Fire Emblem, Brilliant Game. Must buy for any switch owner with a love for turn based strategy.
