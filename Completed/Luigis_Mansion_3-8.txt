Thoughts:
After a dissapointing level based system in Luigis Mansion 2, I am excited
to see that the Switch has once again allowed a series to find a refreshing
and beautiful new entry. Luigi's Mansion 3 is a visually stunning and comedic
romp through a series of hotel floors, each with its own unique theme. Every floor
felt fresh, with unique boss ghosts to suit every floors needs and amazing puzzle
 and room design that made exploration of each floor extremely engaging (the movie floor, 
the Eygptian floor, and the magician floor were my personal favorites).

Now while the world is engaging and the gameplay is fun enough to keep me engaged
for the ~15 hours I spent with the game, the progression of abilities left something
to be desired. Almost all of the abilities bar 1 are given to you within the first 3-5 floors.
While I heavily enjoyed having a wide breadth of tools at my disposal to solve puzzles,
the middle floors didn't feel as impactful due to a lack of new mechanics to enhance
Luigi's arsenal and let him feel more powerful as time went on.
