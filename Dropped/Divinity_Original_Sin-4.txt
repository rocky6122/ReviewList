Thoughts:

There is so much going on in this game that I think with the proper time
and care it could really be something fun to play. However, it is a bit 
to verbose in its menus and game mechanics for me to fully comprehend in a
reasonable manner. For this reason I am dropping the game, but I am hopeful 
that Baulders Gate 3 (from the same studio who made this) will refine the systems
and make them easier to pick up quickly.
