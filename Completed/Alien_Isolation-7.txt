Thoughts:
	The most interesting part of Alien: Isolation is by far the Alien. While 
the majority of the game shares a very similiar tone to Dead Space, the backdrop 
of constantly being hunted by the Alien is what sets it apart. The Alien is smart
and horrifying to hide from. Every time it shows up, it forces you to revaluate 
the situation and think about how you're going to complete your mission with it lurking
in the halls.
	The game opted for a Metroidvania style system of backtracking that while interesting
never really takes off in any meaningful way. I would often re-enter old sections of the ship
without realizing it, only discovering the backtracking via a few solid landmarks.
	The Android enemies in the game were probably the worst part for me. They were slow and
menacing, in the beginning, but they quickly outstayed their welcome and became more of
a nuscaince than a genuine threat. I feel like dodging them added at least and hour of padding 
to the game as most of their spawn points were designed to block your path.
	If you enjoy the Alien universe, then this is probably a perfect game for you. However, in the realm
of Sci-fi Horror games, I would have to give the edge to the Deadspace universe, at least there you 
feel a little more in control.
