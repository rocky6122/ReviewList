Thoughts:
What originally was aclaimed for its atmosphere and stunning visuals unfortunately
has not stood the test of time. Limbo is a rather short and boring game, revolving around
a mechanic described by the devs as "Trial by Death". This means the solution to the puzzles 
the game offers are found via death. In what is surely Dark Souls before its time,
(only 3 months before the release of Dark Souls actually) this game forgoes solid puzzle 
design in an attempt to wow players with its gruesome death animations and its black and white
ambiance. This game is nothing more than an incoherent collection of puzzles strung together
by this, albeit interesting at the time, game mechanic. However, to me this style of design is
lazy and quite honestly boring and I would not recommend this to anyone. It isn't worth the time.
