Thoughts:
While the opening levels were fun to build out, later levels just became much
to complicated for me. The portal mechanic is a nice touch and the intrigue of
building unique solutions to every puzzle was interesting for a few hours, but 
ultimately burnt me out. Personally I couldnt keep up with the difficulty curve.
I often found myself spending 20-30 minutes on a single level only to end up
googling it in the end. For those out there who enjoy puzzles and are smarter than
me it is a pretty interesting set of thought exercises, but those last 20 levels are
to smart for me. So I'm out.
