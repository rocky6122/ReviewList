Thoughts:
	Coming off of Gears 4, I had high expectations for the sequel. However, this game just does not live up
to the legacy created by its predecessors. The dialogue is in some places laughable, with people just 
throwing one liners at each other in an attempt to create an interesting conversation. The story was fine,
but the comedic timing was definitely very off putting, with big enemies often being killed by some random
mcguffin before a final epic fight needed to ensue. While I found the open world sections of the campaign to 
be an interesting idea, no doubt drawing inspiration from Uncharted: Lost Legacy, they ultimately had little 
substance and did not actually have to be open world at all. They became more of a time waster than an interesting
mechanic.
	This game is classic Gears, and the core gameplay loop of running and gunning can easily carry you through its 8ish
hour campaign, but if you're looking for a game with an engaging narrative or innovative gameplay, this can probably be a pass.
