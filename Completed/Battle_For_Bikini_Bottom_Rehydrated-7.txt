Thoughts:

Taking one of the most beloved licensed games of the 2000's and bringing it into
the modern era would be a challenge for anyone, but Purple Lamp has done a great job.
For better or for worse, Rehydrated is a near exact recreation of the original game.
The only real update is in the graphics, which are beautifully vibrant and help truly
capture the feeling of a spongebob episode (especially the newer ones).

It definitely is a nostalgia driven game with mechanics and gameplay that while fun,
don't really hold up today. If you're a fan of spongebob in general or the original game
or even the speedrun, this game is worth playing. It's starting to show its age even 
to someone who loved it growing up like I did, but for now it's still a fun and interesting
little spongebob adventure.
