Thoughts:
When people talk about gaming as an art form, this game is definitely something I think 
people should point to. The beautiful cell shaded graphics create vistas that look as if 
they were paintings, and almost every frame of the game can feel hand crafted. The open world 
is also a major selling point for the game, as its vast and diverse regions provide a wealth 
of opputnity when exploring. The shrine puzzles are also a major highlight, creating new and 
unique ways to solve all kinds of problems given only a few basic mechanics that you start the 
game with (The rune system). However, not everything about the game is perfect. I personally 
found the story to be pretty bland for a JRPG of its size, I understand that Zelda games aren't 
really known for their stories but a well strung narrative could have done wonders for the game. 
There's also a few small things with the "crafting system" that bothered me, like not being able 
to craft arrows and not having recipes being remembered in some sort of book. Everytime I started 
cooking the same recipes it ended up feeling like more of a chore than anything. I also wasn't a 
fan of the durability system in game, where I would constantly be breaking weapons and shields on 
enemies and had to dedicate extra game time to finding more. Overall the game is great though, I 
think it stands out in a crowd for what open world game systems can be and if you own a switch I 
can't recommend it enough.
