Thoughts:
Bringing a much more tactical slant to the hero based shooter,
R6 provides a fresh and realistic take on what a squad based
competetive game can really be. Each hero feels unique and takes
a pretty decent curve to be good at. However, I found the levels
to have a lot of cheeky camping spots thanks to most walls being 
fully destructable. While a very cool and engaging mechanic, I
personally prefer the most structured and predictable gameplay 
of more static map design.
