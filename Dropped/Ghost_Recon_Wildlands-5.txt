Thoughts:
I am ultimately abandoning this game because it failed to live up to 
the precedent set for me in the Ghost Recon series by Future Soldier.
I think that creating a fully open world is an interesting take on the 
series, but ultimately pales in comparrison to the gameplay a more linear
set of levels creates for the stealth/squad gameplay.

Ubisoft seems to be on this weird "make everything open world with tons of
content" kick, and while it might work for some games, there's still a 
lot to be said about smaller more hand crafted experiences.
