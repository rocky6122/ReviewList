Thoughts:
Definitely a return to form for COD. After years of subpar games that revolved
around crazy 3d movement it is great to finally come back to a more traditional 
game. MW 2019 is mainly carried by its brilliant campaign. Being able to reimagine
the original Modern Warfare character is a genius way to invigorate nostalgia and 
keep players engaged (Personally can't wait to see Ghost). The missions are also very
well done, with unique gameplay oppurtunities and some very engaging stealth missions 
that have something to say about the moral choices we make in games.

The biggest thing that holds this game back currently is its multiplayer. Most of the map
design is very poor, with the biggers maps even having major pop in issues. I also almost
feel wrong to say this, but I think the game might have to much gun customization. Every gun
has nearly 100 skins and 60 attachments, its just too much to try to unlock. It makes unlocking
something feel boring, which should never be the case.
