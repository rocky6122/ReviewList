Thoughts:
Injustice is easily my favorite fighting game series to date.
The range of DC characters and the moves they are equipped with
perfectly encapsulate the DC universe. Dedicated the B button to
hero abilities on all characters makes the game instantly accesible
to fans of the universe, just press B and you'll pretty much do what you
expect that character would do (Green Arrow shoots an arrow, batman uses
a batarang, etc).

The narative is also a masterclass in DC comic book writing. Genuinely the 
plot of Injustice 2 is more interesting than anything the DCEU has ever
written. Granted the scope of the project if it were film would be ambitious,
but it just hits so many of the right notes that DC always seems to lack.

The only glaring problem I have with the game is the new equipment system.
This allows you to change armor and costume parts on characters to enhance/modify
their abilities in matches. Honestly I find this to be unbalanced and unfun.
It hides alternate costumes behind complex hard to collect armor sets and
encourages a loot box based system that doesn't need to exist. Hopefully in the future
they will restructure the game for a more enjoyable consumer experience in these areas.
