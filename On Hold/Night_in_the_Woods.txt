Thoughts:

While the narrative is the core focus of this game, there seems to be very little gameplay to back it up.
The gameplay almost serves as the filler content, as I am constantly just walking back and forth from
person to person to talk. Maybe I'll come back to it one day, but for now there are more engaging games to
play.
