Thoughts:
When deciding to make a game, indies often fall upon the "pick 2 of 3" triangle.
The options are narrative, graphics, and gameplay; Only two can be propperly invested in
if you want to make them good. Supergiant very clearly went with gameplay and graphics.
The story honestly feels tacked on and vague; and purposefully so as it adds mystery to the
lack of narrative content. The gameplay to me was clearly the main focus: an interesting
blend of turn based rpg strategy and free flowing hack and slash action. While the pacing 
of unlocks felt a bit off, during the middle hour of the game I found it to be quite tactical.
I was often debating what augments were the best for the next fight and what new combos would do.
However, after unlocking the ping ability the combat quickly fell apart. Ping ended up becoming 
an over powered machine gun with 0 downsides and no counters. I quickly lost interest as combat 
became just a quick point and click instead of the deep tactical game it could be. The final boss
fight was intriguing though, with the boss using your own mechanic against you. I wish they had done
more of those fights, but I can see why they saved it for the end. I think it was a great experiment 
into an interesting mechanic, but ultimately nothing more. Worth the money for the time I spent enjoying
the unique combat, but other than that there is not much else here worth exploring.
