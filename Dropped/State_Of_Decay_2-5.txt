Thoughts:
State of Decay 2 tries a lot to build upon the mechanics of the original game,
but something is lost in the attempted upgrade. The games mechanics
have become far more simulation like and I constantly found myself
confused and tired of the constant struggle to manage everything. 
I think somewhere along the way this game lost the magic that made the first one
so enjoyable. this is why I have decided to stop playing.
