Thoughts:
While Fortnite has blown up to meteoric success, I do not find it to be as engaging as other 
battle royale style titles. The core gameplay of Fortnite that ends up revolving around mining
and building with materials, while an interesting idea, I think takes away from what I enjoy about
the genre. In a game like PUBG for example, buildings and locations are central to the game as 
running out into the open with no cover is a death sentence. With this in mind, when great battles occur 
you're left with a memory of that specific location that has importance in your mind and when you see 
it again it brings the memory back up like a ghost. However, in Fortnite the main locations are merely
drop points before you collect the loot and then head into the open to build structures of your own 
to defend. This takes away the lasting memory that I seem to build with battle royale maps and I think 
it is one of the core ideas that informs my opinion on the game itself. Everything else about the game
is pretty average, which really just leads me into thinking the game is fine as is, but not for me.
