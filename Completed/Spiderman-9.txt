Thoughts:
	Getting a super Hero game right is often one of the hardest things to do in gaming.
To embody not only the mechnical and narrative feel of the character, but to put a new 
spin on it that is both fresh and nostalgic all at the same time. However, In Spiderman
I genuinely believe that Insomniac has done just that. The gameplay is fast and fluid 
and the narrative is probably one of the best Spiderman stories in recent memory. Narratively 
I think this has to do with the grounded struggles of Peter Parker they weave throughout the 
game. Every interaction with MJ or Aunt May or Miles feels realistic and relatable, which is hard 
to do in film let alone in a game.
	Talking about the gameplay itself I thought that the combat was superb, perfecting the 
Arkham combat style while also introducing a vibrant skill tree of moves and slew of gadgets 
to combo to your advantage. The side content was also enjoyable and rarely a slow down, allowing 
me to swing through the city and organically run into and discover new things to do. The only boring parts 
came with the more 'walking simulator' parts of the game using MJ and Miles. Two of them, the one
 where MJ can direct Spiderman and the one where MJ gets a taser, were in particular rather interesting but 
overall they felt more like a slow down than a meaningful part to the story.
	In closing I think that Spiderman is one of the greatest Super Hero games ever made. It's light
hearted, fun, colorful, and really pays homage to the source material in its own way. I'm going to get the 
Platinum Trophy in this game (A first for me) and I am excited to see what Insomniac does with the DLC and
what they will do next as a company.
