Thoughts:
While I absoultely love the idea of new games and concepts in
the Minecraft universe, I'm not completely sure this game hits 
the mark. While the gameplay itself is fun moment to moment,
the long term progression system is lackluster. Grinding out mobs
for the possibility of a higher value loot piece can become redundant
and the lack of compelling narrative or exciting level design
does not particularly have me hooked.

I think it is fun with friends with the odds stacked against you,
and definitely fun for the first playthrough. However, when the game
starts to ask for more and more playthroughs of the same levels,
the game doesn't really bring enough new content or interesting
progression to keep me hooked.
