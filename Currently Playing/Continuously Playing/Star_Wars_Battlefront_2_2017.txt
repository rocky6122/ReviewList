Thoughts: 

Playing Battlefront 2 over three years since its initial launch has certainly
given the game a better light than at its release. At release it was bogged down
in poor balancing and horrible microtransaction systems. However, playing it
in 2020, I find the game to be extremely fun. The multiplayer conquest style modes
feel balanced and exciting, with every class and special character feeling unique.
It honestly gives me the same wonder and excitement I had when playing the original
games as a child. Although I do wish it was easier to play as the Heroes from time
to time.

The only real main complaint is the campaign. I get that it really is supposed to be
a small side portion compared to the multiplayer, but Star Wars has some of the richest
story potential out there, and confining the campaign to around 4-5 hours really felt
like a disservice. The short time frame made the story feel extremely rushed, and ultimately
more like a tutorial for the game before you hop into multiplayer.

Honestly if you enjoyed the original battlefront games but were looking to play them with
full multiplayer compatability, this game is a great way to fill the gap.
