Thoughts:
While I found the political and moral concepts to be interesting, the gameplay
leaves much to be desired. It really begins to feel like tedium instead of interesting
interaction, which perhaps is the point.
I think the game does a great job of making a statement about what it wants to in its short
playtime, but I just couldn't find the passion to keep stamping passports to reach an ending.
