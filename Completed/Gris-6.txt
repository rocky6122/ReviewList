Thoughts:

A very short yet well thought out indie game. While the narrative if any
went straight over my head, the game's art and level design were very well
done. The UI and game design were a great example of minimalistic design.
This game feels very art house. I think for anything above $5 this game might
not be worth the play just due to its length, but if you can catch it on sale
or on gamepass it is a fun and quick experience.
