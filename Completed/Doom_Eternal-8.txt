Thoughts:
Doom Eternal is chaos in its purest form. Improving on all fronts
from the 2016 reboot, Eternal takes the core gameplay loop of Doom
and pushes it to the limit. Combat is as frantic as ever: running,
shooting, looting, screaming. The story was also much more detailed than
the first game. Now I actually feel as if I understand the lore of
the Doom universe, and to be honest it is quite interesting. Getting to see
the other worlds of Doom besides hell was a welcome addition to the game,
especially when adding some more color and variety to the blood red flesh of hell.

The Fortress of Doom was also a great touch, being able to unlock new items and
to work towards finding all the slayer keys added things to look forward to as you play.
My only major complaint with the game is I wish that I could have used the giant
mech thats sitting in the basement of the Fortress. Like come on, I've been fighting and 
looking at giant demon titans all game, just let me get in the mech.

If you played the first Doom I think that you will enjoy this as well. While I dont
find this game to be a "must play" for the series or for gamers, I do think that it
is worth checking out if you have the time/money. Also, fuck the Marauders.
