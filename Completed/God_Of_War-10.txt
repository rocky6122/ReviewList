Thoughts:
	Rebooting a franchise is a feat within itself, but to take Kratos 
(an originally offensive and  by today's standards boring protagonist) and make
him not only likeable, but deeply empathetic is a feat beyond the abilities of 
most game developers. Every story beat I felt for Kratos and his son on their epic
journey to honor his wifes last wish. The characters were engaging and each one felt
like an important piece of the world. I feel like I genuinely learned about Kratos and 
his struggles; the game even had me feeling nostalgic for past events in previous games
I haven't even played. I also somehow managed to learn a decent amount of Norse Mythology along the way.
Every part of the this games story was masterfully told and I cannot wait to see where the sequel takes
 the Ghost of Sparta next.

	From a gameplay perspective I also found a breath of fresh air. The linear nature of 
the series has been intermixed with a metroidvania approach with several small hubs and areas
that are retread in new ways everytime. To see it done on such a beautiful AAA scale was amazing 
to say the least. Just getting lost in the nooks and crannies of the world felt organic, and the
stories, fights, and items found there are some of the best parts of the game. The combat itself was
also a treat. New weapons and mechanics were introduced progressively to allievate repetetive fight scenarios
and the scale of the larger enemies was something truly exilerhating to experience while battling.

	If you have a PS4 you need to play God Of War. It is easily one of the best exclusives on the platform 
and has me eagerly waiting to see whatever Sony Santa Monica does next.
