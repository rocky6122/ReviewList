Thoughts:
The graphics and audio in this game are some of the best I've ever seen.
The weather while driving along the roads of Britain feels so realistic
in both atmosphere and gameplay that it is hard to find a better racing 
game out there. However, simulation racers aren't really my thing, and 
honestly the time I spent with it, while fun, was more than enough for me.
