Thoughts:
While the revised gameplay aprroaches of the last two Assassin's Creeed titles have been
refreshing, I find them slowly becoming more and more distant from what Assassin's Creed 
is actually about. Going furthur back in time then before even the founding of the order
that would eventually become the Assassin's Order was a bad move. Throughout the main campaign
there is absolutely 0 reference to the overall Assassin vs Templar narrative that made the 
original games so intriguing. While an argument could be made that the Cult of Kosmos is a 
precursor to the Templars, that is not explained and coincidental at best. The gameplay was 
honestly the only thing that kept me going for so long, but it did start to wear thin at the end.
The Mercenary gameplay quickly became a nuisance as random high level enemies would hunt you down
while you're just trying to play the game. I also found the Cult subplot to become tedious after a while,
being level restricted as to who you could hunt, and most clues being useless as to who the target you're
after actually is. Ultimately the game suffers from a large amount of quantity of quality, way to much to do
with very little substance. Hopefully the series moves back into the classic, quality currated, large city 
Templar vs Assassin formula, before I end up losing interest all together.
