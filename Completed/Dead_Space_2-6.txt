Thoughts:
	When people think Dead Space I think most of them would think gritty 
scifi horror. While this holds true to the original game, I don't think 
the sequel deserves the same description. Where the first games horror 
was created by tension, the unknown, and a genuine fear created by the creatures, 
Dead Space 2 relies much more heavily on jump scares and blood/gore to try 
and achieve the same effect.
	The story is also a little bit worse than the originals, trying to build of the 
first without really building out the lore of the universe in any meaningful way.
While returning to the Ishimura again was exciting, I think that was the only memorable
part of the campaign. The first game crafted a relationship between the player and the 
environment which Dead Space 2 unfortunately fails to capitalize on.
	Gameplay is very similar to the original. Most of the things in the shop were free,
which I didn't understand and to be honest found to be a quite boring idea. (I just reused
guns I used in the first game) Honestly there could almost be an argument that the gameplay 
is less varied than in the first game, as the series moves more towards a straight action game.
After playing this I am still interested in the series and will play the 3rd installment soon, but 
if you had to play only one Dead Space, it wouldn't be this one.
