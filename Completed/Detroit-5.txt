Thoughts:
Detroit is a story game with a few genuinely great scenes, but not enough to warrent
the 10 hour playtime. Out of the 3 main protagonists I only found Connor to be compelling,
though I did somewhat enjoy Markus's story despite its predictable story beats. The entire 
Alice storyline I found out of place with the other two until the very last second, and 
ultimately just not as interesting as the others. Gameplay wise I found the mechanics to be quite
cumbersome, requiring strange button combos in rapid succesion in order to execute mundane tasks.
However I think the games relationship systems were well done with believable interactions (though
some interactions happened out of my control that would impact relationships, which really bothered me).
For people who enjoy the interactive story telling medium and studios like TellTale I think it is worth 
a look. Also for what its worth the graphics are very well done, so if your a graphic heavy gamer I'd recommmend
at least watching a few gameplay videos to get scratch that graphical itch.
